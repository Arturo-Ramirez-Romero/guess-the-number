# Guess the Number!

Introducing **Guess the Number**, my inaugural JavaScript project! Immerse yourself in the thrill of guessing a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. This interactive game serves as a playground for the foundational JavaScript concepts I've recently acquired.

## Features

* **Guess a Number:** Input your guess, and receive immediate feedback on whether your chosen number is higher or lower than the hidden number.
* **Feedback Loop:** Engage in a dynamic feedback loop, adjusting your guesses based on the hints provided.
* **Victory Announcement:** Upon successfully guessing the correct number, discover how many attempts it took and relish in your triumph!
* **Replay with a Twist:** Experience the excitement of playing again with a fresh challenge each time. The game avoids repeating previously generated numbers, so aim to conquer all numbers from 1 to 10.

It's exciting to share my initial experience in web development while implementing essential concepts such as DOM manipulation, flow control structures, and functions. This project represents the beginning of my journey in programming and reflects my commitment to learning and applying new skills. While it's a straightforward game, behind every line of code are hours of effort, research, and problem-solving. I hope you enjoy playing as much as I enjoyed creating it!

I'm eager to receive feedback and suggestions to continue improving. This project is not just a game but also a key piece in my development as a aspiring web developer. Thank you for being part of my journey!
